         Supported internships for learners with an education, health and care plan 
      </h1>

      <p class="govuk-body">
      Supported internships are a work-based study programme for young people aged 16 to 24 with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND), who have an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/children-with-special-educational-needs/extra-SEN-help">Education Health and Care (EHC) plan</a>.
      </p>    

      <p class="govuk-body">
    Supported internships equip young people with the skills they need to secure and sustain employment through learning in the workplace, with support from a qualified job coach. They last between 6 to 12 months
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
Supported interns are enrolled with and supported by a learning provider, but spend most of their learning time â€“ typically around 70% in the workplace.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
      Alongside their time with the employer, supported interns complete a personalised study programme delivered by the school/college, which includes the chance to study for relevant qualifications, if appropriate, and English and maths at an appropriate level.
