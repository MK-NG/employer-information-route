        A traineeship is a skills development programme that includes a work placement. 
      </p>    

      <p class="govuk-body">
    The full programme can last from 6 weeks up to 1 year, though most traineeships last for less than 6 months.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Your business needs to be able to offer at least 70 hours of a safe, meaningful, and high-quality work experience. You will work with a training provider to design the programme.
